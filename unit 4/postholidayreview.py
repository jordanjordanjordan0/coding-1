# data types - level 1: most basic building block of
# code . (numbers, letters, true or false)

# operators - level 2: the ability to manipulate and
# do things with data types
# (math, comparisons, assignment, etc )

# functions - level 3: taking the first two concepts and
# organizing these operations and data types
# into instuctions

# conditional statements: level 3a: 



# Billing System Function
# Goal: To be able to check and see if a user is past
# due or up-to-date on their subscription 

# user - username= string
# user - userPaymentDate = string/ integer
# user - PaymentAmount = integer

# we need to know if their account
# past due OR up-to-date

# function definition - tells the computer what the
# function actually does and how its supposed to work
